Thanks for looking!\nI'm a recent CS grad who is interested in systems programming mainly in virtualization.\nThis blog is an attempt at technical writing. I mostly write about things I recently discovered and found interesting.\nI am actively looking for full time opportunities in Systems programming.\nYou can check out my Linux Kernel patches\nto get some idea about my work. \nFeel free to reach me at:\n\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nGitHub\nEmail\n\n","id":"https://glitzflitz.github.io/about/","title":"About Amey"},"https://glitzflitz.github.io/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://glitzflitz.github.io/blog/","title":""},"https://glitzflitz.github.io/blog/lfxreport/":{"body":"Background\nPCI and PCIe devices may support a number of possible reset mechanisms, for example Function Level Reset (FLR)\nprovided via Advanced Feature or PCIe capabilities, Power Management reset, bus reset, or device specific reset.\nCurrently the PCI subsystem creates a policy prioritizing these reset methods which provides neither visibility\nnor control to userspace. This project would work to expose the reset methods available per device to userspace,\nlikely via sysfs, and allow a administrative user or device owner to have some ability to manage per device reset\nmethod priorities or exclusions.\nThis feature aims to allow greater control of a device for use cases as device assignment, where specific device or\nplatform issues may interact poorly with a given reset method, and for which device specific quirks have not been\ndeveloped.\nCurrent Mechanism\nThe current policy of prioritizing reset methods is,\nDevice specific reset -&gt; PCIe FLR(Function level reset) -&gt; PCI AF(Advanced Feature) FLR -&gt; Power Management reset -&gt; Slot reset -&gt; Bus reset. \nThe supported reset mechanisms are probed when device is added:\npci_init_capabilities()\n\tpci_probe_reset_function()\n\nCurrently there is no way of knowing which reset methods are supported by the device for the userspace.\nThe reset can be initiated by writing 1 to the /sys/bus/pci/device/.../reset sysfs attribute which will\ntry resetting the device by using reset methods in an order mentioned in above policy.\npci_reset_function()\n\t__pci_reset_function_locked()\n\t\tpci_dev_specific_reset()\n\t\tpcie_flr()\n\t\tpci_af_flr()\n\t\tpci_pm_reset()\n\t\tpci_dev_reset_slot_function()\n\t\tpci_parent_bus_reset()\nProposed Change\nThe patch series introduces a new byte array in struct pci_dev\nto keep track of ordering of device supported reset methods.\nInitially when user has not set any preferred reset method or ordering of multiple reset methods,\ndevice supported reset methods are ordered by exisiting policy.\n ➜  ~ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:02:00.0/reset_method\nflr,bus\n\nWriting any of the supported device reset method enables that method\n➜  ~ echo bus,flr &gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:02:00.0/reset_method\n➜  ~ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:02:00.0/reset_method\nbus,flr                                                                                                                                                                                  ➜  ~\n\nWriting empty string to reset_method attribute will disable device from being reset while\nwriting default will return to original value.
