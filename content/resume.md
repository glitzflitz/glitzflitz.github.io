## **Personal Projects**

In my personal time, I take time to explore new technologies that interest me, writing or about areas I am knowledgeable in or currently learning, and contribute back to open source projects. My notable projects include:

* [GlitzBoy, C](https://github.com/glitzflitz/GlitzBoy) - A fast cross platform Gamboy(DMG) emulator written in C. GlitzBoy supports sound, several hardware types and Real Time Clock(RTC)
* vhost-user-scsi, Rust - Implemented an emulated SCSI backend to be used in linux kvm based hypervisors for virtio-scsi using vhost-user protocol
* [Game of Life, Rust](https://github.com/glitzflitz/gameoflife) - A one hour introduction to embedded systems for non-engineers
* [Linux Kernel Patches](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=amey+narkhede)
