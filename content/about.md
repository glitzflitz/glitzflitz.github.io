## Hey, I'm Amey. Thanks for looking!

I'm a Software Engineer at AWS working on on EC2 virtualization features pertaining to large scale harwdare acceleration(Ahem GPUs, FPGA).
This blog is an attempt at technical writing. I mostly write about things I recently discovered and found interesting.
You can check out my [Linux Kernel patches](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=amey+narkhede)
to get some idea about my work(Update: about my work from my student days :)). </br>
