## Hey, I'm Amey. Thanks for looking!

I'm a recent CS grad who is interested in systems programming mainly in virtualization.
This blog is an attempt at technical writing. I mostly write about things I recently discovered and found interesting.
I am actively looking for full time opportunities in Systems programming.
You can check out my [Linux Kernel patches](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=amey+narkhede)
to get some idea about my work. </br>
